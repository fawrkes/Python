Python Projects
================

In high school, I worked on a few small python projects. The first is my first ever piece of code that I wrote which is a simple tie breaker for two people to use.

The second project I worked on was a bouncy ball that simply bounces around the screen. His name is bouncy and he's supper happy =)
